              <h2 class="font-display text-3xl text-navy mb-6">A Journey of Recovery and Purpose</h2>
              <p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                More than 13 years ago, I found myself at a crossroads that many of my patients know well. Struggling with addiction, I couldn't see a way forward. Today, I'm living proof that recovery isn't just possible—it's the beginning of a fuller, more meaningful life.
              </p>
              <p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                That experience didn't just shape my personal life; it became the foundation of my professional calling. When I work with patients facing depression, addiction, trauma, or the weight of daily stress, I bring more than clinical knowledge. I bring genuine understanding.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Professional Background -->
            <div class="reveal reveal-delay-1 mt-12">
              <h2 class="font-display text-3xl text-navy mb-6">Clinical Excellence</h2>
              <p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                My decade in mental health includes years at The Meadows Behavioral Healthcare, one of the nation's most respected treatment centers for trauma and addiction. There, I had the privilege of learning from pioneers like Dr. Claudia Black, whose work on family systems and addiction recovery has helped countless people heal.
              </p>
              <p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Board-certified as a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, I combine evidence-based medication management with a deep understanding of what actually helps people get better—not just clinically, but in their real lives.
              </p>

              <h2 class="font-display text-3xl text-navy mb-6">My Approach</h2>
              <p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                I believe in treating the whole person—mind, body, and spirit. My faith has been a cornerstone of my own recovery, and I understand that healing often involves more than just finding the right medication. It's about rebuilding hope, reconnecting with purpose, and finding the strength to show up for your life again.
              </p>
              <p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                That said, I welcome patients of all backgrounds and beliefs. What matters most is that you feel heard, respected, and supported on your own terms. We'll work together to find what works for you.
